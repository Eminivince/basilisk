# Basilisk

> Project name: **Basilisk** — the mythical creature whose gaze was said to be
> fatal. A fitting handle for a tool whose job is to stare at smart contracts
> until their flaws surface. Short, memorable, not already claimed by a major
> security tool.

Basilisk is an AI-driven smart-contract auditor for the EVM. Point it at a
GitHub repository or an on-chain address and it will pull the sources, walk
across multi-repo layouts, resolve proxies to their implementations, run
static analysis, reason over the findings with an LLM agent loop, and — when
a vulnerability is plausible — reproduce it as a runnable proof-of-concept.

**Project status — Phase 1: scaffolding. No audit logic yet.** This commit
establishes the Cargo workspace that later phases will build on.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`). Install with
  [rustup](https://rustup.rs/); the pinned toolchain will be fetched
  automatically on first build.

That is the full prerequisite list today. Later phases will depend on
Foundry, Heimdall, Aderyn, and friends — but as Rust crates compiled into
the single `audit` binary, not as external tools you have to install.

## Quickstart

```sh
cargo build                      # debug build
cargo build --release            # single statically-linked `audit` binary
cargo run -- --help              # top-level help
cargo run -- recon 0x1234...     # phase-1 stub: logs the target, exits 0
cargo test                       # runs the smoke test
```

The release binary lands at `target/release/audit`.

## Demo

Against the Aave V3 Pool proxy on mainnet:

```sh
audit recon 0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2 --chain ethereum
```

Produces (trimmed):

```
System resolved from 0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2 on ethereum (id 1)
  Contracts: 2 resolved, 0 failed
  Graph edges: 3 (1 ProxiesTo, 0 FacetOf, 0 Historical, 1 StorageRef, ...)
  Duration: 3.42s

Contract 0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2 (root)
  Chain:    ethereum (id 1)
  Verified: yes (via etherscan)
  Name:     InitializableImmutableAdminUpgradeabilityProxy
  Proxy:    EIP-1967 Transparent
    Implementation: 0x5faab...(trimmed)
    Admin:          0xEC568...(trimmed)
  Bytecode: 1763 bytes (hash 0xabcd...)
  Sources:
    rpc:       https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/***
    explorers: sourcify=not-verified, etherscan=found(full)
    note:      upgrade-history unavailable (RPC provider limits log queries
               — upgrade RPC plan or set RPC_URL_<CHAIN> to a provider without
               range limits)

Contract 0x5faab... (implementation)
  Name:     PoolInstance
  ...
  References:
    storage slot 0x07 → 0xACL... (ACLManager)
    bytecode 0x3fe   → 0xWETH... (WETH9)
```

What you're seeing: proxy pattern identified (Transparent), implementation
one-hop-resolved, and library contracts discovered via bytecode `PUSH20`
scanning surface as `storage/bytecode` references. The note line is
informational — Alchemy's free tier caps `eth_getLogs` range, so upgrade
history didn't come back. Point `RPC_URL_ETHEREUM` at a paid-tier RPC (or a
provider without range caps) to get the full `Upgrade history: N upgrades`
section populated.

Rendering the graph:

```sh
audit recon 0x87870... --chain ethereum --dot /tmp/aave.dot
dot -Tpng /tmp/aave.dot -o /tmp/aave.png
```

### Source-side recon

`audit recon` also classifies local paths and GitHub URLs. Against the
`foundry-minimal` fixture shipped with this repo:

```sh
audit recon crates/project/tests/fixtures/foundry-minimal
```

Produces:

```
Project at .../crates/project/tests/fixtures/foundry-minimal
  kind: foundry
  configs: foundry.toml
  solc: 0.8.20
  remappings: 2
  sources: 2 file(s)
  tests: 1 file(s)
  imports: 4 resolved, 0 unresolved (0 file(s) with unresolved)
  externals: 2 file(s) reached via imports (deps)
```

Unresolvable imports are surfaced separately, not silently dropped:

```
Unresolved imports (2):
  src/Good.sol:5  "./does-not-exist.sol"
  src/Good.sol:6  "@missing/Something.sol"
```

GitHub URLs follow the same path — the repo is shallow-cloned into
`~/.basilisk/repos/` (or refreshed with `--no-cache`), then the same
pipeline runs against the working tree:

```sh
audit recon https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template
audit recon https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.0.2
```

For users who just want the classifier output without a clone, add
`--no-fetch`:

```sh
audit recon https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template --no-fetch --output json
```

Inspect or prune the persistent clone cache:

```sh
audit cache repos stats                     # count + disk usage
audit cache repos list                      # table of cached repos
audit cache repos clear --owner foundry-rs  # scoped wipe
```

## Architecture

Single-binary tool delivered as a Cargo workspace. Today the workspace
contains three crates; later phases slot in beside them without reshaping
the tree.

```
crates/
├── cli/        — the `audit` binary: argument parsing, subcommand dispatch.
├── core/       — shared types (Target, Config, Error) used by every other crate.
└── logging/    — tracing-subscriber setup, shared across the binary and tests.
```

Planned crates (arriving in later instruction sets, one at a time):

- `recon` — turn arbitrary inputs (URLs, addresses, paths) into a typed `Target`.
- `static-analysis` — Aderyn/Slither-style checks over Solidity sources.
- `decompiler` — Heimdall-based decompilation for unverified on-chain targets.
- `agent` — the LLM-driven reasoning loop that plans, tools, and reports.
- `rag` — indexed retrieval over historical incidents and docs.
- `exploit-synth` — synthesize and run Foundry-style PoCs.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the keys your workflow needs.
Every key is optional at startup; features that require a specific key fail
loudly at the point of use, not on launch.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt-check                  # formatting gate
cargo lint                       # clippy with -D warnings
cargo test-all                   # whole-workspace test run
```

Cargo aliases can't chain multiple cargo subcommands, so CI is spelled as
three separate aliases rather than a single `cargo ci`.
